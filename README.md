While Redux is one of the most popular tool to manage an app's state on the frontend, it's also possible to use it on the backend as well. This small project is just a try to implement both frontend and backend logic with Redux.

Tech stack:
Redux, React, Webpack, Babel, Socket.io, Immutable.js, Mocha

This project is based on the [article](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) of [Tero Parviainen](https://github.com/teropa).
